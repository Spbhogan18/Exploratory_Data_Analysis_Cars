# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile Dataset  
### *A Production Engineering–Aligned Automotive Analytics Project*

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the publicly available **Automobile Dataset (UCI Repository)**.  
It highlights key automotive engineering relationships such as engine design, powertrain characteristics, weight distribution, and production-cost indicators.

Designed as a portfolio project for the **Master’s in Automotive Production Engineering (MAPE)** at **Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Germany**.

## 🧭 Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze how technical automotive parameters influence:
- Manufacturing cost  
- Powertrain design decisions  
- Fuel efficiency  
- Vehicle weight optimization  
- Pricing strategy  
- Engineering trade-offs  

The analysis focuses on engineering insights rather than just visualization.
